## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Management
- **Flight Data Scraping**: Automated collection of flight information
- **Database Seeding**: Scripts for populating initial flight data
- **Dynamic Triggers**: Real-time pricing adjustments based on demand

### Pricing Algorithm
- **Scarcity-Based Pricing**: Prices increase as seats become scarce
- **Search Frequency Analysis**: Temporary price adjustments based on route popularity
- **Proximity Pricing**: Higher prices closer to departure date
- **Revenue Optimization**: Maximize revenue while maintaining competitiveness

### Security & Performance
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse
- **IP Banning**: Automated blocking of malicious requests
- **Pagination**: Efficient flight search with pagination
- **Caching**: Optimized performance for frequent queries

## üìä Key Metrics

- **Total Seats**: 222 (Airbus default configuration)
- **Seats Available**: Real-time seat count tracking
- **Revenue Tracking**: Total revenue earned per flight/route
- **Booking Analytics**: Route popularity and booking patterns

## üéØ Business Logic

### Dynamic Pricing Factors
1. **Scarcity**: Prices increase as available seats decrease
2. **Search Frequency**: Temporary price hikes for popular routes
3. **Proximity to Departure**: Higher prices for last-minute bookings
4. **Route Demand**: Historical booking data analysis

### Status Management
- **Live Updates**: Real-time flight status from BOM airport
- **Variance Introduction**: Random delays and status changes for realism
- **Diffusion Simulation**: Realistic status propagation

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Database system (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Node.js/Python for backend
- Frontend framework (React/Vue.js)
- Payment gateway integration

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:setup

# Seed initial data
npm run db:seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üìã API Endpoints

### Flight Search
- `GET /api/flights/search` - Search flights with filters
- `GET /api/flights/:id` - Get flight details
- `GET /api/flights/status/:id` - Get live flight status

### Booking Management
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `GET /api/bookings/:pnr` - Get booking by PNR
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id` - Update booking

### User Management
- `POST /api/users` - Register user
- `GET /api/users/:id/bookings` - Get user bookings

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Considerations
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing for fast queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session and flight data
- **Load Balancing**: Handle high traffic during peak booking times
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health tracking

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/flight_booking
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY=your_payment_key
FLIGHT_API_KEY=your_flight_api_key
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

## üìà Future Enhancements
